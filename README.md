# Monopoly-Game
First Project Ever.. Plenty to smile about...

Done it on year 1 / 1st semester at University.
I barely knew even how to write functions at this point.
OOP ? No. All done old-school :)
Plenty of control statements.

Can't buy houses or hotels, but all the other functionality is there.
All the squares I've built myself from scratch - probably my proudest moment... )))
